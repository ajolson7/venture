  <h2>What we do:</h2>

  <p class="whatWeDo">
    Many people throughout the world like to adventure in the great outdoors. Many of those people have to go through expensive guide services in order to rent the gear or machines they need in order to do the activities that they enjoy. Even if they own the gear at home it is hard to travel with and can add great cost to any vacation.

    There are also many people who own the gear but do not use it on a daily, weekly, or even monthly basis. It is an expensive investment to only use a few times a year.

    We are here to connect those people. Our product will allow people who own outdoor gear like RV’s, campers, boats, paddle boards, ATV’s, and many other things to rent them out to others for periods of time. It will allow them to post when and for how much their gear is available for rent. On the other side it will allow those who are going on vacation to find rentals close to their destination and avoid the hassles and cost of renting gear through a guide service. It creates a network that allows outdoor enthusiasts to come together and help one another in enjoying the great outdoors.
